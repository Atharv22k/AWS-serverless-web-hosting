## Features

- **Fully Serverless**: No need to manage servers or infrastructure.
- **AWS Amplify**: Simplified deployment and management.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Automatically handles scaling based on user demand.
- **Integrated Backend**: Includes authentication, database, and storage services.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on all devices.

## Prerequisites
